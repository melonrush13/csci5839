## Assignment

 After you have finished the reading, create a one-page storyboard sketching out the workflow for how you would send a photo to a contact on your mobile phone (as it works currently; do not invent a new interface for this activity). You can create an annotated storyboard as in Section 4.1, a narrative “film-style” storyboard as in Section 4.3, or a combination of the two
