# Assignment 6: Prototyping

## Readings

- Beaudouin-Lafon and MacKayâ€™s chapter on *Prototyping Tools and Techniques* from the **HCI Handbook**
  
## Assignment

For your class project, think about methods in the Beaudoin-Lafon and Li articles. Write briefly about which techniques might be best for your project, and why

## Response

### Prototypes

We will need to create prototypes for designing our public display. Below are the following *types* of prototypese which will be benefical for our project:

- We will use **rough sketches** to allow early evaluation of design ideas. We want to make something easy to iterate on, that isn't time consuming while we work to understand what our main goals of our public display are.

- We will create **working prototypes** to understand how users interact with our dashboard. We want to understand what is confusing to the user, and how we can make the process easier and more natural.

- Once we feel confident with our working prototype and have built something accessible, and usable for the public, we will create a **software prototype** using a tool such as Adobe XD.

### Prototyping Strategies

There are many types of prototyping strategies, including: horizontal prototypes, vertical prototypes, task-oriented prototypes, and scenario-based prototypes.

For our project, *scenario-based prototypes* will be a great technique to ensure we are designing for every typ of situation. We want to target real world tasks, such as "where to best catch a fish", because our dashboard is going to be a tool used in the middle of the real world world.

### Techniques

**Brainstorming:** Lucy and I will both have great ideas for what to put on our public display, and how to arrange it. That being said, we will probably not always agree. Brainstorming is important because we can work off of eachothers ideas, to make something stronger than our individual ideas. I'm confident Lucy and myself could individually make beautiful dashboards for our project. Although together, we can make something even greater by proving eachother wrong and right, and iterating accordingly. Since it will be only two of us, we will not need to worry about one persons opinion overcoming an entire room of designers. We will stick to the simplest form of brainstorming, and draw out ideas together.

**Heursitic Evaluation:** I think it very important to use this technique to understand human cognition, memory, and sensory perception (as stated in the article). We want to truely understand the user and what *they* would like to see from a live data dashboard of the Boulder Creek. Here is a start:
  
- *Who is Involved:* Fisherman, Families, and individuals enjoying the Boulder Creek, or using the Creek for recreational activites
  
- *Where the Activites Take Place*: The Boulder Creek. Specifically, Eben G. Fine Park, and peninsulas facing the creek where fisherman can fish.
  
- *What the User Does:* fish, swim, take photographs, paint, walk dogs, take fishing classes, run, bike, meditate, eat, tube, and more!!

Once we have these pieces in mind, we need to think about what is important for the users to do these tasks more successfully and efficiently. We will take on the roles of each of these groups, and create prototypes for each one of them individually.
