## Assignment

Describe any thoughts you wish to share about the reading, and sketch out a task model related to some part of either your research or classwork.

### Personas

One thing that really stood out to me from the article, Personas, was that "You will have far greater success by designing for one single person". This reminded me of a Ted Talk I recently watched, [Choice, Happiness and Spaghetti Sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIiAAhUeR6Y). Howard Moskowitz was a researcher who conducted user studies at companies. He did a study at Prego to find the "perfect spaghetti sauce". From this study, he learned there was no perfect sauce - just perfect sauces for different people. One third of Americans preffered chunky spaghtti sauce, and yet not one company had developed one.

I think this is a perfect example on the importantance of understanding your audience. If we design for one person - the one who likes chunky salsa - we will have far greater success than designing for an entire population. People are very different and we must categorize them into different groups. If we made things everyone thought was okay, we would have a product noone was passionate about. This is a great example on the importance of designing for a single person.

Overall, I think Personas are a great concept. It is critical to design for different audiences, and get to the core of what people want. Especially because  people often do not know what they want!

Although, I highly disagree with the article and their assumptions on developers. Developers were referred to as heavy math thinkers who refused to associate with personas. Instead, they categorized all personas under a single group - the user. This is unfair to categorize all developers with this fixed mindset. I will touch more on this in the next article, Contextual Design, where I noticed even more assumptions.

To be fair - I did really like the idea of printing out all the personas and putting them on a wall for the developers to see. It is easy for anyone to get caught up in their work, and  forget the *why* behind what we are doing. Having a visual reminder around helps bring our focus back, and be concious of the personas created while making small decisions throughout  the day.

### Contextual Design

I disagreed with most of this article, so brace yourself. :)

In summary, contextual design is the process of gathering data about the user, and relaying this information to development teams and key decision makers. The purpose is to make smarter decisions when setting requirements for a project. The user needs to be at the center of our requirements.

The CEO at Microsoft, Satya Nadella, loves to use the phrase "customer obsessed". It is the core priority in every organization at Microsoft - through sales, and engineering teams. He uses this phrase often in his book, [Hit Refresh](https://www.amazon.com/Hit-Refresh-Rediscover-Microsofts-Everyone/dp/0062652508/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=78477684692572&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=hit+refresh+satya+nadella&qid=1568211798&s=gateway&sr=8-1). I agree with Satya. The customer, and the people using technology, are the top priority when designing and developing software. If engineers are creating technology for no reason - who will use it? What is the purpose? There needs to be an intent behind the tools people create. Therefore, we must study and understand the users and the problems they have.

I agree with gathering customer requirements and understanding their needs before developing. I do not agree with the assumptions and process for doing this in which the article states.
