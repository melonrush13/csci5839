## Assignment

Describe any thoughts you wish to share about the reading, and sketch out a task model related to some part of either your research or classwork.

### Personas

One thing that really stood out to me from the article, Personas, was that "You will have far greater success by designing for one single person". This reminded me of a Ted Talk I recently watched, [Choice, Happiness and Spaghetti Sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIiAAhUeR6Y). Howard Moskowitz was a researcher who conducted user studies at companies. He did a study at Prego to find the "perfect spaghetti sauce". From this study he learned there was no perfect sauce - just perfect sauces for different people. One third of Americans preffered chunky spaghtti sauce, and yet not one company had developed one.

I think this is a perfect example on the importantance of understanding your audience. If we design for one person - the one who likes chunky salsa - we will have far greater success than designing for an entire population. People are very different and we must categorize them into different groups. If we made things everyone thought was okay, we would have a product noone was passionate about. This is a great example on the importance of designing for a single person.

Overall, I think Personas are a great concept. It is critical to design for different audiences, and get to the core of what people want. Especially because  people often do not know what they want!

Although, I highly disagree with the article and their assumptions on developers. Developers were referred to as heavy math thinkers who refused to associate with personas. Instead, they categorized all personas under a single group - the user. This is unfair to categorize all developers with this fixed mindset. I will touch more on this in the next article, Contextual Design, where I noticed even more assumptions.

To be fair - I did really like the idea of printing out all the personas and putting them on a wall for the developers to see. It is easy for anyone to get caught up in their work, and  forget the *why* behind what we are doing. Having a visual reminder around helps bring our focus back.
