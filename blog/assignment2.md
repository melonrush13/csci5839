## Assignment

Describe any thoughts you wish to share about the reading, and sketch out a task model related to some part of either your research or classwork.

### Personas

In summary, personas are created by designers to represent real people when going through the design process. The goal is to create products that fit the goals of individual people, instead of a general "user" audience.

 The article states, "You will have far greater success by designing for one single person". This reminded me of a Ted Talk I recently watched, [Choice, Happiness and Spaghetti Sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIiAAhUeR6Y). Howard Moskowitz was a researcher who conducted user studies at companies. He did a study at Prego to find the "perfect spaghetti sauce". From this study, he learned there was no perfect sauce - just perfect sauces for different people. One third of Americans preferred chunky spaghetti sauce to regular spaghetti sauce. Yet not one company had developed a sauce with chunks of tomato in it!

I think this is a perfect example on the importantance of understanding your audience. If this user study was never conducted, it could have been years until chunky sauce was created. People are very different and we must categorize them into different groups for desigining. If we take the "average" best product after doing a user study, we are finding something everyone thinks of as okay. We must dive deeper, and repeat the process in sub groups. Then, we can find the best sauce for everyones taste buds - because we know people have very different preferences when it comes to taste. This is a great example on the importance of designing for a single person.

Overall, I think personas are an excellent process to make sure we are hearing everyones voices when we are making products. Although, I think this is simply a sliver of the problem. The article continuly refered to the developers as being "guys". We can listen to personas and create user studies, but at the end of the day, if all males are the ones making the final decisions - then we are missing the point. We need to have a set of diverse engineers to ensure every voice is heard and every voice is being coded for directly.

I was shocked about the diversity comments made around creating make belief personas. The author stated "I am shooting for believability, not diversity". For example, if we are creating a persona around a nurse, the author suggested making it a female since "there are commonly more female nurses than male nurses". If we continue to develop for stereotypes, we are creating biased technolgy. The article also suggested creating the engineer to be a pimply face, nerdy male. Is it so difficult to think of a beautiful, blonde woman engineer? This needs to change. I hope designers are understanding the world is changing, and they need to change, too.

### Contextual Design

I disagreed with most of this article, so brace yourself. :)

In summary, contextual design is the process of gathering data about the user, and relaying this information to development teams and key decision makers. The purpose is to make smarter decisions when setting requirements for a project. The user needs to be at the center of our requirements.

The CEO at Microsoft, Satya Nadella, loves to use the phrase "customer obsessed". It is the core priority in every organization at Microsoft - through sales, and engineering teams. He uses this phrase often in his book, [Hit Refresh](https://www.amazon.com/Hit-Refresh-Rediscover-Microsofts-Everyone/dp/0062652508/ref=sr_1_1?hvadid=78477684692572&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvqmt=e&keywords=hit+refresh+satya+nadella&qid=1568211798&s=gateway&sr=8-1). I agree with Satya. The customer, and the people using technology, are the top priority when designing and developing software. If engineers are creating technology for no reason - who will use it? What is the purpose? There needs to be an intent behind the tools people create. Therefore, we must study and understand the users and the problems they have.

I agree with gathering customer requirements and understanding their needs before developing. Although, I do not agree with the assumptions and process for doing this in which the article states.

The article describes engineering-driven as a bunch of guys getting together to think of cool features to ship. Throughout
