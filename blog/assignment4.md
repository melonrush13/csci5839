### Mobile Device Adoption

There is no easy solution to creating a mobile device which addresses the needs of all users. Since users have very different needs, it makes sense to make different phones which target different users. For people with visual impairements, there is a specific mobile device which provides a better experience based on their needs and problems. I was happy to hear phones like this exist. Although, I was saddened to read users with visual impairements typically buy consumer cell phones because their alternative phone is 10x the price.

This made me wonder - What is the point of making a device that solves a solution if that solution is unaccessible?

Reading this article reminded me of the work Bill and Melinda Gates do in their foundation. A large problem the foundation is investigating is child mortality due to diarrhea. The foundation donated millions of dollars to help design a waterless toilet to be more sanitary for communities. One company helped Bill and Melinda create a perfect toilet to solve the problem, but it cost $50,000. Although this toilet solved the problem, it doesn't mean it is the right solution. The foundation budgeted $150 per toilet, so they had to readjust.

I think this approach applies from toilets to mobile phones. If we don't truely understand the user and the population we are designing for, we are making inusable products. This is another example on the importance of interviewing our users, and doing research before we design.
