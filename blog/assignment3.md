### Cultural Probes

I remember previously hearing the term "cultural probes", and recalled it being an interesting technique for designers. I wanted to read this article to reunderstand what they were used for, and some examples of it in action.

While reading the article, I found it strange how zero context was given on the concept of cultural probes before the study was explained. I had to reverse engineer to understand what was happening.
 
 I learned the goal of cultural probes is to understand the thoughts, emotions, interests, and environment of a user. This is done by providing the user with a collection of tools and items.

The study from the article wanted to find a better way to involve the senior living population with their communites. To find a solution, designers put together the following items for their cultural probe to better understand their audience:

- postcards
- map
- camera
- photo album
- media diary

The designers didn't seem to recieve a ton of *new* information from the probes. Some of the elderly communities lost interest and continued on with their daily lives. Although, this didn't seem to affect the new design decision regardless. Which made me wonder, *what is the point of using cultural probes?*

I loved learning about the media diary and how it was used to record daily interactions. Elders recorded information in the study such as every instance they watched TV, how long they watched it, etc. I think using a diary to collect any form of usage data is powerful. For example, recording dreams in a dreambook, instances of a specific emotion being triggered, amount of water intake per day, etc.

Recording these things helps the user be more aware of their environment, which I think is the whole point of a probe. I think whatever technique people choose to use, it is an excellent idea to gain more understanding of our actions and environment. I would be interested in creating a cultural probe to see how affective it can be, but am also happy asking the right questions at a smaller scale to gain the same understanding.
