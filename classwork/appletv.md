## The Remote

I think programming without a keyboard sounds miserable. That is why I wanted to use a drag and drop GUI program like Scratch for the Apple Remote. Users can build programs or games by dragging and dropping code blocks onto the screen by using the Apple remote like a Wii controller, or using the devices 6 buttons.

These buttons include the following:

- Category Button
- Code Block Button
- Microphone
- Confirmation Button
- Forward Button
- Backwards Button

### Category Button

Used for selecting a code block category - such as motion, operators, variables, control, or sensing - which are some of the options in the GUI based programming tool Scratch. When clicking the category button, the user will see the list of categories to choose from on the screen. Using the forward and backward buttons, the user can select a category they would like to see corresponding code blocks from.

### Code Block Button

The code block button allows the user to toggle between code blocks. The user can select which code block they want using the forward and backward buttons. Once they find their desired code block, they can hit the confirmation button and it will pop onto the screen.

### Microphone

If at any point of time the user is have difficulties, the microphone can be used to give voice commands instead of using the Apple remote's functionality.

### Confirmation Button

This is used to select an option once it is hovered over in a list.

### Forward Button

Allows the user to select the next choice in a list.

### Backwords Button

Allows the user to select the previous choice in a list.

## The Remote: Alternative Functionality

If the user does not want to use the buttons on the Apple Remote, they can choose to use the remote's accelerometer to drag and drop the code block on the screen instead, similar to using a Wii remote.
