# Interviews

09/25/2019: Interview your partner (or be interviewed) about an activity they do.

## Participants

**Interviewer:** Vinitha

**Interviewee:** Mel

## Discussion

**Activity:** Looking up cute dogs online

### Questions

Vinitha did a great job at keeping the conversation generic. She smoothly switched conversation topics, which helped Mel stay on topic and not on one point for too long. She asked excellent follow up questions, and made the conversation feel very light natural.

Some questions included:

- Where do you search for dogs online?
  
- How often do you look up dogs?
  
- Do you have any problems with the websites you use to look up dogs?
  
- What do you wish could be better about the websites?
  
- What is your intent at looking at dogs?

- What do you do when you find a dog you like?

### Insights

Mel likes to look at 3 different websites online for cute dogs available in the Boulder/Denver area. These websites include:

- [Boulder Humane Society](https://www.boulderhumane.org/dogs/)
- [Lifeline Puppy](https://www.lifelinepuppy.org/puppies/)
- [L.O.L.A.'s Rescue](http://www.lolasrescue.com/)

Here are a couple of problems Mel encounters:

- Dogs have a very high turnover rate. If you find a dog you like online, it is sometimes gone in a couple of hours

- Mel checks 3 different websites for dogs
  
- Mel doesn't have any notifications of new puppies arriving, and sometimes misses cute pups before they are "on hold"

- Mel can't put a dog "on hold" online, and must call the shelter to put a dog on hold

- Mel wishes the filtering options were better on websites

- Mel dislikes that Lifeline puppy and L.O.L.A's websites are not always up to date

### Important Take Aways

After chatting, Vinitha enlightened Mel on a wonderful website called [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) which combines all of the humane society pages into one. Her new hobby has been changed for the better.
