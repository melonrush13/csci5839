# Interviews

09/25/2019: Interview your partner (or be interviewed) about an activity they do.

## Participants

**Interviewer:** Vinitha

**Interviewee:** Mel

## Discussion

**Activity:** Looking up cute dogs online.

**Interview Insight:**

Mel likes to look at 3 different websites online for cute dogs available in the Boulder area. Those websites include:

- [Boulder Humane Society](https://www.boulderhumane.org/dogs/)
- [Lifeline Puppy](https://www.lifelinepuppy.org/puppies/)
- [L.O.L.A.'s Rescue](http://www.lolasrescue.com/)

Here are a couple of problems Mel faces:

- Dogs have a very high turnover rate. If you find a dog you like online, it is sometimes gone in a couple of hours.

- Mel has to check 3 different websites for dogs.
  
- Mel doesn't have any notifications of new puppies arriving, and sometimes misses cute pups.

- Mel can't put a dog "on hold" online, and must call the shelter to put a dog on hold.

- Mel wishes the filtering options were better on websites.

- Mel dislikes that Lifeline puppy and L.O.L.A's websites are not always up to date.

**Discoveries:**

After chatting, Vinitha enlightened Mel on a wonderful website called [Petfinder](https://www.petfinder.com/) which combines all of the humane society pages into one. Her new hobby has been changed for the better.

Vinitha did a great job at keeping the conversation generic. She didn't point Mel down one direction for too long, and kept asking great follow up questions. She had some great starting questions, which lead to deep conversations, and then she switched topics for more insight smoothly.

Some questions include:

- Where do you look up dogs?
  
- How often do you look up dogs?
  
- Do you have any problems with the websites you use to look up dogs?
  
- What do you wish could be better about the websites?
  
- What is your intent at looking at dogs?

- What do you do when you find a dog you like?
